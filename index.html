    <div class="popup" id="popuphover1" style="display:none">Durham's office is a converted textile mill&mdash;a stylish choice, but it's basically just barnhouse chic.</div>
    <div class="popup" id="popuphover2" style="display:none">Durham has very few options for lunch within walking distance&mdash;at one point nothing but a food truck&mdash;compared to Vancouver, where there are dozens of options within a block or two.</div>
    <div class="popup" id="popuphover3" style="display:none">For much of their very hot summer, Durham's air conditioning was broken, making it extremely uncomfortable to work in certain areas of the office.</div>
    <div class="popup" id="popuphover4" style="display:none">The office nap pods Durham's pride and joy. But no one uses them.</div>
    <div class="popup" id="popuphover5" style="display:none">The Charlottesville office has an arcade room with a number of different games. The popularity of the arcade ebbs and flows.</div>
    <div class="popup" id="popuphover6" style="display:none">The fourth floor has a large boardroom and a training space but is otherwise unoccupied.</div>
    <div class="popup" id="popuphover7" style="display:none">On the day of a key stakeholder meeting, Charlottesville indulged the team with lobster as an option at the cafe&mdash;super bougie.</div>
    <div class="popup" id="popuphover8" style="display:none">Vancouver hosts a weekly brunch every Monday with a rotation of local breakfast foods&mdash;not to mention Canadian maple syrup.</div>
    <div class="popup" id="popuphover9" style="display:none">A common complaint among Charlottesville Trees is how long it takes to get from one meeting room to another. It's as if they still have tiny offices in seven buildings downtown.</div>
    <div class="popup" id="popuphover10" style="display:none">On November 29, 2022, the Columbus Blue Jackets were dead last in the Eastern Conference. They rank behind even the Ottawa Senators, a team so unsuccessful, Ryan Reynolds is about to buy them. Columbus is 24-38 against the Vancouver Canucks all time.</div>
    <div class="popup" id="popuphover11" style="display:none">The pronunciation of "sick of more" emulates "Sycamore", the name of the Columbus branch merged from Orange and Rich Mahogany. Having two branches was deemed too fine-grained. ü•Å</div>
    <div class="popup" id="popuphover12" style="display:none">"Buckeye" was a crowd favorite for the new Columbus branch name, but was not picked. Ohio State fans found this preposterous.</div>
    <div class="popup" id="popuphover13" style="display:none">While Jamie probably didn't have anything to do with the branch name decision, this lyric insinuates that she may have put her finger on the scale.</div>
    <div class="popup" id="popuphover14" style="display:none">A bookshelf in Columbus opens up to reveal a secret conference room. It's notably quite cold.</div>
    <div class="popup" id="popuphover15" style="display:none">Of the three major US WillowTree-brand office sites, Columbus is the largest metro area. The video contrasts Columbus with Vancouver both in scale and visual appeal.</div>
    <div class="popup" id="popuphover16" style="display:none">Trees in Columbus compete for bragging rights in the Thurmanator Challenge, in which they speed-eat a huge burger consisting of two 12-ounce patties, lettuce, tomato, mayo, pickle, banana peppers, saut√©ed mushrooms, onions, ham, mozzarella and American cheese.</div>
    <div class="popup" id="popuphover17" style="display:none">The lyrics imply work-from-anywhere trees use Zoom's touch-up feature to improve their appearance. A spicier reading would infer that Fig branch teammates have gone full goblin mode since the pandemic began.</div>
    <div class="popup" id="popuphover18" style="display:none">Our CEO is notoriously a pilot.</div>
    <div class="popup" id="popuphover19" style="display:none">While being at home with your pets is nice, it's tough to be on remote meetings all the time. And it's a bit too easy to work late when going to work only entails sitting at a desk.</div>
    <div class="popup" id="popuphover20" style="display:none">Patrick, our Durham-based Chief Engineering Officer, is a chatty work-from-office devotee.</div>

        <span>[Verse 1]</span><br />
        <span>I've known a few Trees who thought their office was chill</span><br />
        <span>This ‚Äútrendy‚Äù space that‚Äôs just an <span class="spanhover" id="hover1">old textile mill</span></span><br />
        <span class="spanhover" id="hover2">You‚Äôve got one choice for lunch, that must get old pretty fast</span><br />
        <span class="spanhover" id="hover3">And it sounds like your A/C just isn‚Äôt up to the task</span><br /><br />
        <span>[Pre-Chorus]</span><br />
        <span>Oh-oh, you think you‚Äôre special</span><br />
        <span>Oh-oh, you think you‚Äôre something else</span><br />
        <span>Okay, so you've got <span class="spanhover" id="hover4">nap pods</span></span><br /><br />
        <span>[Chorus 1]</span><br />
        <span>That don't impress me much</span><br />
        <span>So you‚Äôre off to sleep, that must be such a rush?</span><br />
        <span>Now, don't get me wrong&mdash;yeah I think you‚Äôre alright</span><br />
        <span>But I‚Äôm not coming in just to hang with <span class="spanhover" id="hover20">Patrick Wright</span></span><br />
        <span>That don't impress me much</span><br />
        <span>Uh-huh, yeah, yeah</span><br /><br />
        <span>[Verse 2]</span><br />
        <span>I heard about this office with a fancy arcade</span><br />
        <span class="spanhover" id="hover5">With all those pretty games, no one ever plays,</span><br />
        <span class="spanhover" id="hover6">And all those extra rooms on four&mdash;you‚Äôve got space aplenty</span><br />
        <span>What a shame three days a week it must feel awful empty</span><br /><br />
        <span>[Pre-Chorus]</span><br />
        <span>Oh-oh, you think you're special</span><br />
        <span>Oh-oh, you think you're something else</span><br />
        <span>Okay,  so you had <span class="spanhover" id="hover7">lobster</span> for lunch?</span><br /><br />
        <span>[Chorus 2]</span><br />
        <span>That don't impress me much</span><br />
        <span>So you got the lunch, but <span class="spanhover" id="hover8">have you got the brunch?</span></span><br />
        <span>Now, don't get me wrong&mdash;yeah, I think you're alright</span><br />
        <span class="spanhover" id="hover9">But walking to a room shouldn‚Äôt be such a long hike</span><br />
        <span>That don't impress me much</span><br /><br />
        <span>[Guitar Solo]</span><br /><br />
        <span>[Verse 3]</span><br />
        <span>I understand Columbus has a hockey team</span><br />
        <span class="spanhover" id="hover10">But no one's ever held them in very high esteem</span><br />
        <span>You were <span class="spanhover" id="hover11">sick of more</span> branches, <span class="spanhover" id="hover12">Buckeye lost that fight</span></span> <br />
        <span>Now come on, <span class="spanhover" id="hover13">Jamie</span>, tell me&mdash;you must be joking, right?</span><br /><br />
        <span>[Pre-Chorus]</span><br />
        <span>Oh-oh, you think you're something special</span><br />
        <span>Oh-oh, you think you're something else</span><br />
        <span>Okay, so you've got a <span class="spanhover" id="hover14">secret room</span></span><br /><br />
        <span>[Chorus 3]</span><br />
        <span>That don't impress me much</span><br />
        <span class="spanhover" id="hover15">You've got an office downtown, sounds pretty plush</span><br />
        <span>Now, don't get me wrong&mdash;yeah, it's a nice place</span><br />
        <span>But who‚Äôd want to win a <span class="spanhover" id="hover16">giant cheeseburger race?</span></span><br />
        <span>That don't impress me much</span><br />
        <span>So you work from home, we know you <span class="spanhover" id="hover17">use the touch up?</span></span><br />
        <span>Now, don't get me wrong&mdash;yeah, your dog is alright</span><br />
        <span>But <span class="spanhover" id="hover19">I can't be on Zoom all day and all night</span></span><br />
        <span>That don't impress me much</span><br /><br />
        <span>[Outro]</span><br />
        <span>Okay, so what do you think, you're a <span class="spanhover" id="hover18">pilot</span> or something?</span><br />
        <span>(Whatever)</span><br />
        <span>That don't impress me.</span><br />
